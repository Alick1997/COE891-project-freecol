# COE891 - Software Testing: Freecol

## Description
A fork of the freecol respository used to develop various tests for this repo for the COE891: Software Testing course at Toronto Metropolitan University

## Project
Project test files are placed in the coe891-testing module. 
This is done so as to provide simplicity in developing tests for the freecol project as the test mosule is already quite populated.

## Concepts used in testing
### Input Space Partitioning
- Uses Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) to create test requirements and cases.
- Implement tests based on the various test cases.

### Graph based testing (CFG and DFG)
- Draws a Control Flow Graph and Data Flow Graph of various methods.
- Use these graphs to implement different test cases and requirements such as all-def and all-use paths.
- Implement tests based on these test cases.

### Logic Based Testing
- Create test requirements based on different logical predicates and clauses.
- Create test cases based on the requirements.
- Implement tests based on test cases.

### Mutation Testing
- Modify the programs under tests in small ways to implement mutation testing.
